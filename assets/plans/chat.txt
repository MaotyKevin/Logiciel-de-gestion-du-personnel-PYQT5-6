To set up a chat system between an admin user account and a sample employee account in your PyQt5 desktop application using an SQLite database, you can follow these steps:

Database Setup:

Extend your existing SQLite database schema to include chat-related tables. You might have tables for Admins, Employees, and now add tables for Chats and Messages. Here's a simplified example:
sql

Copy code
CREATE TABLE Admins (
    admin_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT,
    password TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT,
    password TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Chats (
    chat_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    admin_id INTEGER,
    employee_id INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (admin_id) REFERENCES Admins(admin_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employees(employee_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Messages (
    message_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    chat_id INTEGER,
    sender_id INTEGER,
    message_text TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (chat_id) REFERENCES Chats(chat_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES Admins(admin_id)
);
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication for both admins and employees when they log in to the application.
After login, retrieve the user's ID from the database, which will be used to identify the sender of messages.
Chat Creation:

When an admin initiates a chat with an employee, create a new record in the Chats table, linking the admin and employee's IDs.
Message Sending:

In the chat interface, the admin user can input and send messages.
When a message is sent, create a new record in the Messages table. Set the chat_id to the relevant chat, the sender_id to the admin's ID, and the message_text to the content of the message.
Message Retrieval:

For the employee, display a list of chats they are involved in.
When an employee clicks on a chat, retrieve the chat's messages from the Messages table for display.
Display Messages:

Create a chat interface where messages are displayed, similar to common chat applications.
Messages sent by the admin will be displayed on one side, and messages from the employee on the other.
Real-time Updates:

If you want real-time updates, you may need to implement a mechanism like polling the database for new messages or use a real-time messaging system (e.g., WebSocket).
Security:

Ensure that the chat system is secure. Messages may contain sensitive information, so protect them from unauthorized access.
User Interface:

Design a user-friendly chat interface for both admins and employees, including message input boxes, chat selection, and message display.
Testing and Refinement:

Thoroughly test the chat system to ensure it works as expected. Refine the user experience and make improvements based on user feedback.
